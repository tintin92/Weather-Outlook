Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions. Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## Features
Search bar for user to input a city of their choice. Once the user hits the submit button they will then be shown the current weather including temperature, wind, and uv index. 

###Learning Lessons

I'm still working on my AJAX calls to get info back from weather api. I was able to properly display various weather based on the users search request. 

To do this... we will be creating three different API calls 
    currentWeather
    forecast
    UV index
