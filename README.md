# Weather-Outlook-

Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions. Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## User Story 

Travelers need to know the weather outlook for multiple cities. For this project I will be creating a weather dashboard that presents the user with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV. 

To do this... we will be creating three different API calls 
    currentWeather
    forecast
    UV index
